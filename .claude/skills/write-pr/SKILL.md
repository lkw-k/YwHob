## Step 1 — Find the Base Branch

Don't assume `develop` or `main` — ask the repo, since projects here use both.

```bash
git branch --show-current
gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name
git ls-remote --heads origin develop development dev | sed 's#.*refs/heads/##'
```

`BASE` is the integration branch if the remote has one, otherwise the default branch. Use it everywhere
below.

## Step 2 — Gather Context

```bash
git fetch origin "$BASE" --quiet 2>/dev/null || true
git log "origin/$BASE..HEAD" --oneline
git diff "origin/$BASE...HEAD" --stat
git diff "origin/$BASE...HEAD"
cat .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md 2>/dev/null
```

## Step 3 — Learn This Project's Scope Vocabulary

The scope belongs to **this** project's domains, not to a fixed list. Read what the repo already uses
before inventing anything:

```bash
# scopes used in commit history:  feat(member): ... -> member
git log --pretty=%s -200 | grep -oE '^[a-z]+\(([^)]+)\)' | sed -E 's/.*\((.*)\)/\1/' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
# scopes used in past PR titles:  [member] ... -> member
gh pr list --state all --limit 100 --json title -q '.[].title' | grep -oE '^\[[^]]+\]' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

**If the history shows a vocabulary, reuse it verbatim** — matching the project beats a more accurate
word of your own, and a one-off scope makes the history unsearchable.

If the history has none (new repo, or no convention yet), derive it from the paths you're touching:

```bash
git diff --name-only "origin/$BASE...HEAD"
```

Take the segment that names a domain or deployable unit, whatever this repo's layout calls it:

| Layout | Path | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Domain package | `src/main/kotlin/.../domain/member/...` | `member` |
| Feature module | `src/expo/form/...`, `modules/expo/...` | `expo` |
| Monorepo app | `apps/web/...`, `packages/ui/...` | `web`, `ui` |
| Flat project | `src/services/payment.ts` | `payment` |

Prefer the domain over the layer — `member` tells a reviewer more than `service` or `controller`. If the
change spans several scopes, use `global`; for build/CI-only changes, `ci`.

## Step 4 — Determine Labels

Labels differ per repo, so read the repo's own set and match against it:

```bash
gh label list --limit 100
```

Pick **1–2** by meaning, using `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/labels.md` as the mapping guide. If nothing
matches, attach none — a wrong label is worse than no label, and an undefined one fails PR creation.

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/commit-conventions.md` for type and scope naming rules.

## Step 5 — Generate PR Content

**Title** — Generate 3 options in the format `[scope] description`:

- Scope: from Step 3. Lowercase, in brackets — `[member]`, `[expo]`, `[global]`
- Description: Korean, concise, no emojis, max 50 characters total
- Wrap class names, method names, annotations, file names, and technical terms in backticks (e.g., `@Transactional`, `MemberService`, `SKILL.md`)

**Body** — Follow the `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` structure:

- Korean 합쇼체: `~하였습니다`, `~되었습니다`, `~추가하였습니다`
- No emojis
- Max 2500 characters
- Wrap all proper nouns and technical identifiers in backticks: class names, method names, annotations, file names, field names, config keys, module names, and agent names.

## Step 6 — Write Body & Show Preview

Write the body to `PR_BODY.md`, then display:

```
## PR 제목 후보
1. [title1]
2. [title2]
3. [title3]

## 선택된 라벨
- label1, label2

## PR 본문 미리보기
[body content]
```

Use AskUserQuestion to ask the user which title to use (present options 1/2/3). Wait for the answer before proceeding.

## Step 7 — Create PR

Run the creation script with the confirmed title and labels (it resolves the base branch the same way
and silently drops labels this repo doesn't define):

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/create-pr.sh" "<confirmed-title>" "PR_BODY.md" "<label1>,<label2>"
```

After creation, display the PR URL.
Cleanup: remove `PR_BODY.md`.
